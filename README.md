A horror video game where the player explores a haunted forest, designed to create an immersive and eerie atmosphere. The project was developed using WebGL, with a focus on real-time rendering.

# Key technical features include:

- **Specular Mapping**: implemented to simulate realistic light reflections on surfaces.
- **Normal Mapping**: used to add fine surface details and enhance the sense of depth without increasing polygon count.
- **Dynamic Shadows**: integrated to reinforce the horror mood and increase visual immersion.
- **Shading Techniques**: applied to achieve realistic lighting effects.
